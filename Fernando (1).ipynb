    "Ever since I was a little boy, I have been interested in the factors families decide on when selecting a house. That being said, this growing interest has secretly started to creep on me as I got older, especially for life after college. When deciding where to live, families usually choose a few factors: school, safety, and overall location. That being said, I decided to focus on one of the main factors: how safe the neighborhood is. Furthermore, I chose a dataset that involves the number of arrests per neighborhood in a period of seven years."

As a group, we all had one established metric: to evaluate the \"safeness\" of each neighborhood and then determine the safest neighborhood. However, I measured the number of arrests per neighborhood, specifically by using the data set named Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data. By doing so, I used a bar graph to illustrate the data best.  \n",

    "If you hadn't noticed, the previous bar graph outputted the raw sorted data from all neighborhoods. Although the graph has the x-axis as the total arrests made and the Y-axis as the neighborhoods, the output still resembles the same conclusion that Mount. Oliver and Downtown were both the safest and not the safest neighborhoods in the city most of us call home. Although it outputted what we were looking for, for the data set in the form of a bar graph to be easy to read, I decided on sorting and only outputting the five safest and least safe neighborhoods on my graph."

    "By analyzing our updated graph, we can now examine much more quickly that the five safest neighborhoods on paper are Mt.Oliver, Troy Hill-Herrs Island, Mt.Oliver Boro, Central Northside, and Regent Square in the period of seven years. On the contrary, the neighborhoods of Central Business District, South Side Flats, Cerrick, East Allegheny, and Homewood South are labeled the least safest. By splitting the chart into two different and less amount of neighborhoods, it is more attractive to the human eye. This new and updated graph can now have the power to help our provided audience. "

    "In conclusion, Mt.Oliver would be the prime candidate for becoming the safest neighborhood in Pittsburgh if it was just based on the number of arrests. That being said, if I were to compare it to my favorite neighborhood of Southside, my favorite neighborhood would be known as a \"bad neighborhood.\" However, when compared to each other, their activity levels are highly different due to the number of restaurants, stores, and businesses in Southside compared to Mt.Oliver. In my opinion, you can't base the best neighborhood on just how safe they are rather than on other factors.\n"
